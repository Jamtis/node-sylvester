You can use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install package dependencies. Once you install it, run `yarn` to grab dependencies.

Code is written in TypeScript in the `src` folder. I needs to be compiled before it can be run. You can do so once by running `yarn build`, or start a watcher by running `yarn watch`. I recommend keeping a watcher open during development.

You can run unit tests via `yarn test:unit` or, if you use VS Code, via the `Run Tests` launch configuration (hitting F5 will start them up).
